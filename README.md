This Streamlit application serves as an interactive frontend for a powerful, RAG-based document retrieval agent. The system architecture leverages PyPDF2 for robust text extraction, LangChain for chunking and prompt management, FAISS for local vector storage, and the Gemini API for generative response creation.

Designed to solve the problem of information silos in large documents, the agent acts as an autonomous research assistant. Furthermore, it logs interactions to JSON and calculates standard NLP evaluation scores (BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore) in real time to provide continuous insight into model performance and response accuracy.
